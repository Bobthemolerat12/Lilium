# Lilium Web Proxy (Early beta POC)
## A alloy-like web proxy written in GO
First proxy ive ever wrote and wont be my last, its quite bad and was more of a POC than anything, releasing the source code incase anyone wants to relase some patches since majority of the code was written at 4AM in like a few hours so..
(I do not recommend using this proxy since it does leak and is mainly only good for static sites and nothing like games.)
